### Introduction

Nowadays, advertisement is an important tool in ensuring boosted sales in every business organization, this is because many organizations selling the same products have increasingly emerged, making advertisement one of the best tools for fair competition. Online advertisement is preferred by most organizations due to its strengths in diverse users, expandability, real-time feedback, and strong interactions. 

Click-Through Rate reveals the relationship between the number of views and the number of clicks on an ad, hence evaluating its performance. Predictive analysis can be applied in campaign management, demand planning, customer acquisition, fraud detection, budgeting and forecasting, and many other areas. In this article, I will tell you all you should know to get started in this field under data science. Happy reading!

By the end of this article, you will be able to enter into the field of making your ads more effective and have a strong understanding of the following:

- Data    Exploration
- Data cleaning
- CTR modeling
- Analyzing performance

### Prerequisites

To have a better understanding of this article, you should:
-	Have a basic knowledge of python programming.
-	Have prior knowledge of machine learning concepts such as statics, probability, and calculus.

### Data Exploration

This involves gathering data, uploading it into your program, determining the type of data you are dealing with; knowing its columns, data types present in it, and many other features. In this stage, you will need access to tools such as Microsoft Excel, and spreadsheets. Python data exploration is made easier with Pandas, an open-source Python data analysis library that can single-handedly profile any data frame and generate a complete HTML report on the dataset.

### Data Cleaning

In data cleaning, you will have to make sure there is no redundancy, no null values, no missing value, insertion of important columns, and finally deletion of irrelevant columns. Having a properly cleaned dataset will enable even a simple algorithm to learn impressive insights from the data. Note that different types of data require different types of cleaning. Data cleaning generally helps in avoiding wastage in data investment, making better business decisions, increasing process efficiency, increasing productivity, and reducing overall cost. 

### Modeling

In this stage, you will have to understand the relationships between the models to enable you to select your predictive models. There are several predictive models you can decide on, all under regression and neural networks. For example in selecting linear regression as your preferred model, you need to ascertain that the relationship is continuous and for logistic regressions, the target variable has to be categorical. Having talked about regression, you must understand what it is. Regression is a method of modeling a target value based on independent predictors. It is mostly used for forecasting and finding out cause and effect relationships between variables.

In choosing your model, you need to consider the accuracy of the model, its scalability, whether the model meets the business goals, its speed, and the capability of it being easily understood and explained. Even though logistic regression models are easy to interpret and understand, it has poor performance. It is of low accuracy as it is prone to overfit with many input features, and it cannot easily express non-linear relationships. 

On the other hand, linear regression handles overfitting so well using dimensionally reduction technique, regularization, and cross-validation. Regularization prevents overfitting by artificially penalizing model coefficients. Cross-validation involves evaluating and comparing the algorithms by dividing data into two segments, one for training and one for validation. It is also easy to implement, interpret, and efficient to train. Neural networks involve information processing techniques based on the way biological nervous systems process information.

### Performance analysis

After modeling, you will have to check for the accuracy of your model and its general performance. Accuracy of above 70% is good for a beginner. In ensuring the accuracy of your model you will be increasing the efficiency of your model. For a better analysis of performance, you need to do variance analysis, analyze metrics, review goals, review competitor performance, review customer and market context, and decide on changes.

### Conclusion

Click-Through Rate prediction is a very important topic in the field of data science. I have done a lot of research to give you the best prior knowledge on this topic to enable you to get started. As you may notice, they are several approaches we can give to achieve this task basing our arguments on modeling. It will therefore depend on your preference and the approach which will best fit you.
